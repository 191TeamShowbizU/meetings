#MVP

We showed our present sponsor our finished MVP, which was the ShowbizU forum site. We made video walkthroughs to send to Tim because he was unable to attend the meeting. She was extremely happy about it and said it looked great.

#Feedback

They really liked it and suggested some minor tweaks (adding like, vote up, and vote down options).

#Over Summer

Our sponsors decided that it would be beneficial to learn HTML5 and Javascript over the summer. In addition, since they are transitioning to HubSpot, we are required to earn the certifications provided from the site. All of these goals are to be done individually, but every member of the team must complete them.
