## Time and place

## Business case changes

+ In the business case, we decided to explicitly state that we were going to be developing a MOOC alone instead of addressing multiple issues of the website (i.e. the community section). We addressed the issue of the “Learning Paths” that the client desires and broadly broke them down into subjects and courses to explore them further. In addition, we added another target audience demographic.

## Requirements document changes

+ We decided to focus on a part of the client’s vision that was feasible to work on and provided value to the customer. In this sense, we made some assumptions about the requirements of the MOOC and tied them together with the visions of what the client depicted in the first couple meetings. In that sense, some of the requirements are the same because of the generalities they cover.

## Project development and delivery timeline

+ We will deliver a bare interface “core” of the MOOC structure by the end of Week 7.
+ We will create the database to store all information in Weeks 8 and 9.
+ We will integrate both together and tie the content into the website, allowing user to utilize the course during Week 10.
