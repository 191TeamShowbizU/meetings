## Time and place

ICS 193, Irvine, CA, Thurs Apr 10, 10 AM

## Communication schedule

We will meet Sarah (and Tim, if available) in person every Tuesday at ICS 193 at 10 AM.

We will also email them any questions we may have at any time. We will also occasionally provide them with relevant links to information that may be beneficial to the project.

Sarah and Tim will be sending us helpful links along the way relating to the needed content for the MOOC.

## Project goals

The overall main goal of this project is to construct a MOOC style platform for ShowBizU (StoriU) that will have the potential to become a go-to service with the availability and reliability of Google search. This service will bring quality theater education to the web market where it is lacking.
