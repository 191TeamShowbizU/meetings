## Progress

We created our first working prototype of Showbiz U's Vanillaforums site.  All categories have been made and all permissions
have been set for each role.  We have also implemented Single-sign on (SSO) features for Facebook, Twitter, and Google.  
The sponsor liked the progress we made, and also suggested some tweaks, such as turning on approvals for every new post and
modifying the account creation form.

# Rest of the Quarter

We are going to rebuild the site using the new account Showbiz U created.  This will be the account in which the forum will
go live on.  We are also looking into creating a tab on Showbiz U's website, linking it to the forum.
