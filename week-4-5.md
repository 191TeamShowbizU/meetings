## Time and place

ICS 193, Irvine, CA, Tues Apr 29, 10 AM

## Software Design

We discussed software design briefly, and essentially agreed that we are not at that stage right now.  We are currently
focusing on UML flow diagrams and research.

## Skills Assessment and Learning Plan

We discussed our skills assessment and learning plan in-depth, and determined that the best strategy would be to focus on the
non-coding related tasks first.  The client understands that we are a team of 5 non-coders.  The client told us that the current
website is built on WordPress.  Each team member is now learning about WordPress and doing research on Showbiz U's aspects of
community and education.  We agree with this assessment, and have made changes to the learning plan to include these focuses.
