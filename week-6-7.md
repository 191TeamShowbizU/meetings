## Progress

We completed our social media research, UML Flow diagrams, Project Deliverables, and Ning/Vanillaforums research.  Our
approved of all documentation, and determined that Vanillaforums was the best option to move forward with the development
of our community system.

# Next steps

We are currently building and customizing a test Vanillaforums site using Antonio's free trial.  We are going to embed the
forum into the shell site that Showbiz U has, so that we can test it before going live.
